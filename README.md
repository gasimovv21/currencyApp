- pip

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/currencyapp.git
   cd currencyapp
   ```

2. **Set up and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**:

   ```

5. **Set up the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   - Check your IPv4 address to set baseURL for running the server on your local network.
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   - Look for your "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" section, and note your IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
   - Open the App.js file and insert your IPv4 address at the specified location on line 17.

6. **Start the Django development server**:
   - Now, start the Django development server using your IPv4 address:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver <your_IPv4_here>:8000
   ```

7. **Access the API**: Open [http://<your_IPv4_here>:8000/api/](http://your_IPv4_here:8000/api/) in your browser or Postman.

## Running the Backend in Docker
